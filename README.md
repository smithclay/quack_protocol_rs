# quack_protocol

Rust client-side SDK for DuckDB's experimental Quack remote protocol.

The crate implements:

- DuckDB `BinarySerializer`-compatible primitive, object, logical type, vector, and `DataChunk` codecs.
- Quack connection, prepare/query, fetch, append, disconnect, success, and error messages.
- A session pool for running queries concurrently against one server.
- Async HTTP `POST /quack` transport using `application/duckdb`.
- URI parsing for `localhost:9494`, `quack:host:port`, bracketed IPv6, and direct HTTP(S) URLs.
- SQL literal formatting for positional and named parameters.

```rust
use futures_util::TryStreamExt;
use quack_protocol::{QuackClient, QuackClientOptions, Result};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let client = QuackClient::connect(
        "localhost:9494",
        QuackClientOptions {
            auth_token: Some("super_secret".to_string()),
            ..Default::default()
        },
    )
    .await?;

    let (_columns, rows) = client
        .query("SELECT 42::INTEGER AS answer", None)
        .await?
        .into_rows();
    let rows: Vec<_> = rows.try_collect().await?;
    println!("{:?}", rows);

    client.disconnect().await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

## Connection model

A `QuackClient` is **one session** on the server: one connection id, for the
client's whole life and for every clone of it. Two things follow.

**Queries on one client are serialized.** The server keeps a single resumable
result cursor per connection id, and a PREPARE resets it - so a second query
would invalidate a FETCH still in flight. Queries therefore take a lock, and a
result stream holds it until the stream is drained or dropped. Cloning the
client does not change that; the clones share the session.

**Session state persists.** Temporary tables, `SET`, transactions, and attached
databases live on the connection, so consecutive calls on one client see each
other's effects.

For concurrency, use a `QuackPool`. It keeps several sessions and hands a free
one to each caller, so N queries run on the server at once - what a query engine
wants when it opens one scan per partition:

```rust
use quack_protocol::{QuackClientOptions, QuackPool, QuackPoolOptions, Result};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let pool = QuackPool::connect(
        "localhost:9494",
        QuackClientOptions::default(),
        // Size this to the parallelism you want - DataFusion's
        // `target_partitions`, say. Every connection is a DuckDB connection on
        // the server.
        QuackPoolOptions { max_connections: 8 },
    )
    .await?;

    // Each concurrent query runs on its own session.
    let (_columns, chunks) = pool.query("SELECT 42::INTEGER AS answer", None).await?.into_chunks();
    let _ = chunks;
    Ok(())
}
```

`QuackPool` is cheap to clone and shares its connections, so one pool can back
every table in a federated catalog. Connections open on demand up to
`max_connections`; callers past the limit wait for one to come free.

The pool gives **no session affinity** between calls: two `pool.query()` calls
may land on different sessions, so a temp table created by one is invisible to
the other. Work that depends on session state takes a connection out of the pool
and holds it:

```rust,ignore
let connection = pool.acquire().await?;
connection.execute("CREATE TEMP TABLE staging AS SELECT 1 AS id", None).await?;
let ids = connection.values("SELECT id FROM staging").await?;
// `connection` goes back to the pool when it is dropped.
```

A stream returned by `pool.query()` holds its connection until it is drained or
dropped, so drop it when the results are no longer wanted rather than leaving it
parked - the connection is not free until then.

### Closing sessions

A session the client no longer holds is closed, so the server does not keep a
cursor for a connection id nobody can use again:

- `disconnect()` (on a client, `close()` on a pool) closes deterministically and
  reports failure.
- Dropping the last handle to a client - or the pool that holds it - sends the
  DISCONNECT from a background task. That is best-effort: it only goes out while
  the Tokio runtime is alive, so call `disconnect()`/`close()` when the program
  is about to exit or the outcome matters.

### When the server forgets a connection

After a server restart, a session opened against the old server is gone and the
server answers `Invalid connection id`. `QuackError::is_connection_lost()`
reports that case; it means the request was rejected before any SQL ran.

The pool handles this itself: it retires the stale connections and retries the
query once on a fresh one. Only PREPARE is retried, because once results are
streaming the statement has already run - errors from FETCH, and appends, are
passed through untouched rather than risking a repeated write. A plain
`QuackClient` does not reconnect; it is one session, and quietly opening another
would drop the session state that came with it.

## Arrow output

The optional `arrow` feature adds a read-only bridge that turns query results
into `arrow_array::RecordBatch` streams. The Arrow schema is built from the
column definitions returned at prepare time, so it is correct even for results
that carry no rows.

```toml
[dependencies]
quack_protocol = { version = "0.2", features = ["arrow"] }
```

```rust
use futures_util::TryStreamExt;
use quack_protocol::arrow::arrow_array::RecordBatch;
use quack_protocol::{QuackClient, QuackClientOptions, Result};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let client = QuackClient::connect("localhost:9494", QuackClientOptions::default()).await?;

    let (schema, batches) = client
        .query("SELECT 42::INTEGER AS answer", None)
        .await?
        .into_record_batches()?;
    let batches: Vec<RecordBatch> = batches.try_collect().await?;
    println!("{schema}: {} rows", batches.iter().map(RecordBatch::num_rows).sum::<usize>());

    client.disconnect().await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

`into_record_batches()` is the whole entry point. `quack_protocol::arrow`
otherwise only re-exports the `arrow-array`, `arrow-buffer`, and `arrow-schema`
crates, so downstream code can match versions.

The batch stream holds the client's connection until it is drained or dropped,
as `into_chunks()` and `into_rows()` do: a `QuackClient` runs one query at a
time, and a second query on the same client waits for the first stream to
finish. `QuackPool::query` returns the same `QuackResultStream`, so
`into_record_batches()` works there too - and concurrent scans then run on
separate sessions. See [Connection model](#connection-model).

### Type mapping

| DuckDB | Arrow |
|---|---|
| `NULL` | `Null` |
| `BOOLEAN` | `Boolean` |
| `TINYINT` … `BIGINT` | `Int8` … `Int64` |
| `UTINYINT` … `UBIGINT` | `UInt8` … `UInt64` |
| `HUGEINT`, `UHUGEINT` | `Decimal256(39, 0)` |
| `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE` | `Float32`, `Float64` |
| `DECIMAL(w, s)` | `Decimal128(w, s)` |
| `VARCHAR`, `CHAR`, `ENUM`, `UUID` | `Utf8` |
| `BLOB`, `GEOMETRY`, `BIT` | `Binary` |
| `DATE` | `Date32` |
| `TIME`, `TIME_NS` | `Time64(Microsecond)`, `Time64(Nanosecond)` |
| `TIMESTAMP_S`, `TIMESTAMP_MS`, `TIMESTAMP`, `TIMESTAMP_NS` | `Timestamp(<unit>, None)` |
| `TIMESTAMPTZ` | `Timestamp(Microsecond, Some("UTC"))` |
| `INTERVAL` | `Interval(MonthDayNano)` |
| `LIST`, `MAP` | `List(child)` |
| `ARRAY(n)` | `FixedSizeList(child, n)` |
| `STRUCT` | `Struct(children)` |
| `VARIANT` | `Struct(keys, children, values, data)` |

Every field is nullable; the wire carries no non-null guarantee. A `NULL` list,
array, or struct is a null container, not an empty one. `TIME` values must lie
within one day, as Arrow requires, so DuckDB's `TIME '24:00:00'` is rejected.
`TIMETZ` and `UNION` have no Arrow mapping yet and produce
`QuackError::UnsupportedType`.

Three mappings are provisional and may change in a future release: `MAP` is
encoded as `List<Struct<key, value>>` rather than Arrow's native `Map`, `ENUM`
as plain `Utf8` rather than a `Dictionary`, and `VARIANT` as the struct DuckDB
shreds it into rather than Arrow's canonical `arrow.variant` extension, whose
binary encoding is not the one DuckDB sends. A `VARIANT` column therefore
arrives as its physical layout — `keys`, `children`, `values`, and a `data`
blob — the same shape the `Value` path already exposes, and reading a value
back out of it means interpreting that encoding yourself.

Quack is still experimental upstream and not yet covered by a stable official wire spec. This implementation follows DuckDB's `duckdb-quack` extension.
